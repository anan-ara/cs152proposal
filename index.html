<h1>Training a Neural Network to play Pokemon</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>Pokemon is a turn-based game where players use 6 Pokemon to battle each other, with each Pokemon having 4 moves to choose from, as well as the option to switch to a different Pokemon for a total of 5 possible actions per turn.
For this project, I plan to train a neural network to play Pokemon on the online site, <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/">Pokemon Showdown</a>.</p>

<p>Something like this has been done before, called Future Sight AI, but it is closed source, and I believe it would be interesting to try to recreate it with different design decisions. I predict that this project will be similar to training a neural network to play other turn based games, such as chess.</p>

<p>On the Pokemon Showdown website, replay data of ranked matches (think chess) are available, which we could use as training data for the neural network.<p>

<p>The end goal is to have the neural network deployed on Pokemon Showdown, which has an elo ranking similar to chess, and see how effectively it can climb the ladder.<p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Download replay data from Pokemon Showdown and decide on a way to clean/format the data for training</li>
  <li>Explore different approaches in creating the neural network to create the most effective neural network for playing the game</li>
  <li>See and analyze what strategies the NN develops and utilizes in games</li>
  <li>Potentially connections between the NN's training process and how humans learn to play Pokemon, and turn-based games in general</li>
</ol>
